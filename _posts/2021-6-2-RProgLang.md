title: How R is different that other programming languages?
---

In my programming career, I have used many languages such as C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, PHP, SQL, etc. Each programming language used above had niche over other when it comes to the purpose it was built for.

#### Thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
Programming languages such as JAVA, PHP were good for web programming. SQL was great at querying RDBMS. On the other hand, R is purpose built for data analysis using statistics fundamentals. And it does superior job at it. It’s easy to use and provides great performance when it comes to data analysis. One may use R for data analysis without solid statistical background, however R has lot more to offer if you have statistics knowledge. 

#### What I like about R?  
R being Open source is big plus, one can easily extend R capabilities and make it available for others to consume. R has large set of libraries & packages and has great support on internet for issues one may encounter. There is good eco system of software’s & plugins around R, such as R-studio, R-Markdown, Anaconda, etc.

#### What parts do I miss about your other language? 
Modern programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, provides object-oriented programming paradigm. And once used to such paradigm, consuming language which doesn’t embrace it, is bit disheartening.  

#### Is R difficult language to learn? 
R was bit challenging to learn without some knowledge of statistics.  When I started using R first without any statistic knowledge, I struggled understanding R’s functions and parameter used in it. Programming paradigm was different than what I was used to. I could perform preliminary data analysis, such as building clusters (hierarchical, k-means), exploratory analysis and OLS regression with help from internet. But had no idea on what’s the underlying difference between some of the methodologies used. So, in a way my analysis was less credible those days.
