title: Reflection: Take on what data scientist is about?
---

I am about to complete ST558 course at NCSU, where we learned about tools, methodologies and process data scientists will have to follow in their day to day work. At the beginning of the course we wrote a blog about what data scientist is about? Now reflecting back on it, I see one of the important aspect of data scientist role is to communicate in simple language data, findings in exploratory analysis, reasoning for statistical models used for the task at hand and interpretation of model results.
Data scientist have important role to convince clients/business owners about findings from the data obtained using statistical tools and at the same time keep stakeholders aware of the limitations and assumptions associated with it.

what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I learned different facets of R, which I was not aware before, easy containerization of R Applications and end user flexibility provided by Shiny apps are remarkable!
I will certainly continue to use R going forward, as it’s very easy to use, and has ability to provide very quick turnaround to statistical task at hand. It allows preparing –
1.	Documentations (Rmarkdown) around statistical work 
2.	End user customizable user interface.  
3.	Deliver work as container, so we know it will always work.
4.	Has wide collection of libraries and packages.

what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
Going forward, I will be using containerized Shiny apps, RMarkdown reports and containerized Rest-API to process typical dataset I have to deal with day-to-day job.
