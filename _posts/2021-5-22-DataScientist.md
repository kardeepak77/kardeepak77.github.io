title: Take on what data scientist is about?
---

Abundant computing power, reduced data storage costs, and services of on demand computing storage has allowed businesses and institutions to gain better insight from data than ever before. 
These insights are used by businesses such as (Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Tesla, etc.) to differentiate themselves over their competitors and create a more valuable experience for customers. 
Moreover, insights provided by larger amounts of data are needed to be explored by a professional who can not only understand statistics, but also add greater value to a customer’s experiences by using large amounts of data and implementing innovated targeted business strategies. Unlike the traditional statistician, a data scientist has the required skills to go beyond analyzing data and rather aid in using analyses to make high value predictions. 
Data scientists learn statistics, as a statistician would, in the context of innovating the strategies used to increase the value of a business and its outcomes. These scientists understand how people use a certain product or service and the company’s goals to create a tailored business strategy using statistical analyses done on the data available to them. Without this understanding, the data may not have practical value for a business due to losses in translation between the fields of statistics and business. Therefore, it is a data scientist’s job to have the knowledge to implement statistics and use the relevant data available at hand in providing answers to business questions. 

Data Scientist is expected to have knowledge of following areas to perform her/his duties
1. Domain knowledge of the business
2. Ability to translate business requirements into a statistical problem
3. Ability to Identify Statistical approach to the problem. (same as 2)
4. Understand tradeoffs related to model and parameters selection
5. Communicate results and uncertainties to business leaders who may not have a rich statistical background.
6. Have knowledge of statistical programming, to be able to select right software tools for the job.
7. Degree in Statics 
8. Good analytical skills

Both data scientists and statisticians have knowledge of statistics. Traditional statisticians deal more with the theoretical aspect of solving business/institution tasks. On the other hand, a data scientist would act more as a bridge between a statistician and business user and/or a SW programmer.
Traditional statisticians were more focused on designing experiments, collecting data and building models to best describe inference or causal effects. Contrastingly, data scientists mostly optimize statistic tools to better predict and/or prescribe outcomes enhancing business outcomes.

Coming from a business and programming background as well as having knowledge of Statistics now, I can better understand methodology, statistical inference and model choices and their pros and cons. I see myself transitioning to more Data Scientist duties in the future as I gain the experience of using statistics to solve business problems.
